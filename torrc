# This is the configuration file for the portable instance of Tor.
# You will only have to make changes here if you want to run a second
# instance of TorChat on the same machine.
#
# If you want to run multiple instances, change SocksPort
# and the second (ONLY THE SECOND) port in HiddenServicePort below
# to something like (for example) this:
#
#   SocksPort 33309
#   HiddenServicePort 11009 127.0.0.1:33009
#

SocksPort 22209

# we don't use the control port currently, so leave this alone
# ControlPort 11119

# INCOMING connections for the hidden service arrive at 11009
# and will be forwarded to TorChat at 127.0.0.1:22009
HiddenServiceDir hidden_service
HiddenServicePort 11009 127.0.0.1:22009

# You can uncomment the lines below to log Tor's activity to the
# console or to a log file. Use this only during debugging!
# Turning off SaveLogging will leave sensitive information on your disk,
# the built in default is save logging turned on (set to 1).
# so don't remove the # from that line unless you need it
# and remember to put it in again, after you are done.
